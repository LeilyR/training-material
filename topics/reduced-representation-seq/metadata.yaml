title: Reduced-representation sequencing
summary: "Plant, and particularly cereal genomes, are challenging to sequence due\
  \ to their large size and high repetitive DNA.  Reduced representation offers us\
  \ an accessible means to identify parts of the genome are involved in species\u2019\
  \ adaptation to different environments and, ultimately, the formation of new species"
